# Current Initiatives

The work of our committee is achieved through collaborative *working groups*, which are open for anyone who wishes to help achieve our goals. Our current initiatives are below. Please contact the working group leader if you would like to participate.

**Mandatory Anti-Bias Course Working Group**

Goal: To develop curriculum for a mandatory course for first-year PhD students on privilege, bias, anti-racism, and allyship. A course overview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZTFJlK87vyeONS-FRPizQekQ5MCoyF2XAHu0Zn22mw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Remote Personal Wellness**

This includes physical and mental health and will likely include investigating the resources available to students and understanding how students currently address wellness concerns. 

Timeline: One Semester 

Deliverables: A concise document about the key challenges and current resources as well as suggestions for future semesters 

Meeting time: TBD
