# Current Initiatives

The work of our committee is achieved through collaborative *working groups*, which are open for anyone who wishes to help achieve our goals. Our current initiatives are below. Please contact the working group leader if you would like to participate.

**Mandatory Anti-Bias Course Working Group**

Goal: To develop curriculum for a mandatory course for first-year PhD students on privilege, bias, anti-racism, and allyship. A course overview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZTFJlK87vyeONS-FRPizQekQ5MCoyF2XAHu0Zn22mw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Remote Personal Wellness**

Goal: This group will focus on identifying areas where individual wellness can be improved across the body of SCS students. This includes physical and mental health and will likely include investigating the resources available to students and understanding how students currently address wellness concerns. 

Timeline: One Semester 

Deliverables: A [concise document](2020-12-17-coffee-chats.md) about the key challenges and current resources as well as suggestions for future semesters 

Meeting time: TBD
