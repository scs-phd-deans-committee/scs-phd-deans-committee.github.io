# Current Initiatives

The work of our committee is achieved through collaborative *working groups*, which are open for anyone who wishes to help achieve our goals. Our current initiatives are below. Please contact the working group leader if you would like to participate.

**Interested in starting your own working group?**

Any SCS PhD student who wants to work on something in line with our mission statement is welcome to launch their own working group. If you have an interest or even an inkling of an idea, don't hesitate to reach out to scs.phd.committee@gmail.com .

**Mandatory Anti-Bias Course Working Group**

*Goal*: To develop curriculum for a mandatory course for first-year PhD students on privilege, bias, anti-racism, and allyship. A course overview can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZTFJlK87vyeONS-FRPizQekQ5MCoyF2XAHu0Zn22mw/edit?usp=sharing).

**Personal Wellness**

This includes physical and mental health and will likely include investigating the resources available to students and understanding how students currently address wellness concerns. 

Timeline: Three Semesters

Deliverables: A [concise document](wellness-writeup.md) about the key challenges and current resources as well as suggestions for future semesters.

Meeting time: Summer - Every other Wednesday at noon.
