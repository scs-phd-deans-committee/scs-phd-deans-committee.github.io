### Part 2: Department Information 

We requested the following information from departments: 
* Has your department/program set any form of mentoring or environment across cohorts that would allow this institutional knowledge to be easily requested and shared?
* We would like to ask if your department/program has provided ways to help students with their ergonomics needs
* Has your department/program set any form of support for students in regard to access to supplies we would otherwise have easy access to on campus?
* Will there be any department-sponsored activities going over break ex: board games, talks, lunches?
* Is there anything from the department to encourage physical and mental wellness over the semester break?
* Are there ways the department is working to maintain work-life balance between students and faculty?

Their responses are summarized in the following:

    - Information from the Dean's Office: Previously, there was the  SCSÂ Parents fund and the  Tartan Emergency Fund. These funds have now been combined and now CMU administers funds for all students. Each department has a different approach to providing home office equipment and the department business manager and/or department head should be asked.
