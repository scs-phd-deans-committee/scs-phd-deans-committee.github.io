# Undergraduate Research Engagement Working Group (URE WG)

Our goal is to increase SCS undergraduate research participation, improve the undergrad research experience, improve support and resources for graduate student and faculty research mentoring, and encourage disadvantaged and underrepresented individuals to get involved with research for a diverse research community! See [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYcf9KqcQ3-vvu2AGQtvoa65XSDZsu58nRSkUnPV0M8/edit#slide=id.p) for more details about our goals and initiatives.

Ongoing and potential future initiatives:

* Semester Research Mixers for graduate students / faculty to showcase their work, encourage undergrads to try out research, and answer undergrads' questions about research

* Semester Research Mixers to connect undergrads with specific research projects which graduate students / faculty are offering

* Resources such as Slack workspace to build community among the SCS undergrad research community, "onboarding" documents for prospective undergrad researchers and grad student mentors

* Shadow-a-researcher program, lab-meeting-hopping program

* [OurCS](https://www.cmu.edu/cs/ourcs/)-like weekend-long program to encourage URI to get involved with research

* much more to come!

Meeting time: Every Tuesday at 4:30 pm ET in NSH 4201 ([see map](/assets/images/ugrad_research/nsh_map.png)) on [zoom](https://cmu.zoom.us/my/ericaw).
