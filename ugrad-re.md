# Undergraduate Research Engagement Working Group (URE WG)

Our goal is to increase SCS undergraduate research participation, improve the undergrad research experience, and improve support and resources for graduate student and faculty research mentoring.

**Undergraduate Research Engagement**

*Goal*: Increasing SCS undergraduate research participation, improving the undergrad research experience, improving support and resources for graduate student and faculty research mentoring, encouraging disadvantaged and underrepresented individuals to get involved with research! See [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYcf9KqcQ3-vvu2AGQtvoa65XSDZsu58nRSkUnPV0M8/edit#slide=id.p) for more details.

Ongoing and potential future initiatives:

* Semester Research Mixers for graduate students / faculty to showcase their work, encourage undergrads to try out research, and answer undergrads' questions about research

* Semester Research Mixers to connect undergrads with specific research projects which graduate students / faculty are offering

* Resources such as Slack workspace to build community among the SCS undergrad research community, "onboarding" documents for prospective undergrad researchers and grad student mentors

* Shadow-a-researcher program, lab-meeting-hopping program

* [OurCS](https://www.cmu.edu/cs/ourcs/)-like weekend-long program to encourage URI to get involved with research

* much more to come!
