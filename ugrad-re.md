# Undergraduate Research Engagement Working Group (URE WG)

Our goal is to increase SCS undergraduate research participation, improve the undergrad research experience, improve support and resources for graduate student and faculty research mentoring, and encourage disadvantaged and underrepresented individuals to get involved with research for a diverse research community! See [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYcf9KqcQ3-vvu2AGQtvoa65XSDZsu58nRSkUnPV0M8/edit#slide=id.p) for more details about our goals and initiatives.

Ongoing and future initiatives:

* Research Mixers to answer undergrads' questions about research and encourage them to try it out

* Research Mixers to connect undergrads with specific research projects that graduate students / faculty are offering

* Resources such as a Slack workspace to build community among the SCS undergrad research community, "onboarding" documents for prospective undergrad researchers and grad student mentors

* [Shadow-a-researcher program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1POqcH6JRrxkTFlMTOk_CULCcwUvIDv7bw0yvJq2oIKE/edit) (collab with CMU AI Mentoring Program)

* [Lab hopping rotation program](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSencK356aGjfyy91lDc4nqR2YDHzJJbujm3tVPOfmvLwa93Uw/viewform)

* [OurCS](https://www.cmu.edu/cs/ourcs/)-like weekend-long program to encourage URI to get involved with research

* much more to come!
