# Undergraduate Research Engagement Working Group (URE WG)

Our goal is to increase SCS undergraduate research participation, improve the undergrad research experience, improve support and resources for graduate student and faculty research mentoring, and encourage disadvantaged and underrepresented individuals to get involved with research for a diverse research community! See [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYcf9KqcQ3-vvu2AGQtvoa65XSDZsu58nRSkUnPV0M8/edit#slide=id.p) for more details about our goals and initiatives.


## Working Group Details

The URE WG has an "initiative-centered" structure that will be actionable-centered and conducive to getting things done. An initiative can be:
* An organized event, such as the SCS Research Mixers
* A goal, such as working with admin to acquire funding for summer research for underrepresented minorities
Individual WG members will lead initiatives they feel passionate about, the other members of the WG will support them!
During WG meetings, we brainstorm and plan initiatives.

**_Meeting time_: As of Fall 2022, we meet every other Wednesday at 5-6pm ET in NSH 4513 ([see map](/assets/images/ugrad_research/nsh_map.png)). This will likely change in future semesters, based on working group member availability. If you are interested in improving the research experience for CMU ugrads, please join a meeting or email dpac-ugrad-re [at] andrew.cmu.edu to find out how you can contribute! :)**


## Ongoing Initiatives 

* [Research Mixers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYcf9KqcQ3-vvu2AGQtvoa65XSDZsu58nRSkUnPV0M8/edit#slide=id.g10112176f67_0_38) to connect undergrads and masters students with research projects and grad / faculty mentors

* [Ugrad-ugrad "Speed-dating"] to connect undergrads research veterans (e.g. senior thesis students) with undergrads new to research

* [Research Panels](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZYcf9KqcQ3-vvu2AGQtvoa65XSDZsu58nRSkUnPV0M8/edit#slide=id.g10112176f67_0_47) to answer undergrads' questions about research and academic life, and to encourage them to try it out

* Graduate Student Mentorship Workshop to equip grad student mentors, particularly [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS)](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) mentors, with the skills necessary to advise younger students on research projects

Each semester we host at least 1 research mixer oriented towards matching students looking for a research project with a project, and 1 event oriented towards informing students new to research about research life. We will post upcoming events to the mailing listis scs-ugrads [at] lists.andrew.cmu.edu, scs-ms-students [at] cs.cmu.edu, and scs-phd-students [at] cs.cmu.edu.
